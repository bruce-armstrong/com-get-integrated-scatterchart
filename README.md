Qlik Sense Scatterplot with Customizable Popups

This sample is based off the [Qlik Sense Extension with D3 tutorial](http://blog.axc.net/tutorial-how-to-build-a-qlik-sense-extension-with-d3/). 

I've added a Tooltip section that allows the user to specify up to four items of information that will be used in a popup that appears when the mouse is moved over a datapoint.
